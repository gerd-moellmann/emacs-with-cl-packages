* emacs-27.2-mac-8.2 (2021-03-27)
Based on Emacs 27.2.
The configure option --with-mac-metal is disabled by default.
I originally turned it on because it lowered the CPU load.
But I recently realized that it was caused by its lower frame rate.
M1 Mac accomplishes 60fps with or without Metal even with large
frames, and the CPU load does not get an advantage from the use of
Metal there.

*** Can't unexec on macOS 10.15.4.

*** Crash when editing iCloud Drive files on macOS 10.15 - 10.15.3.
This is due to Mach port leaks on these versions.  A workaround is

*** Several animation effect glitches for executables linked on 10.15.

*** Can't switch application in Split View after resizing on macOS
10.14 and later.

*** Clicking "+" in tab group overview creates a new frame instead of
tab on macOS 10.15.

*** High CPU load on dialog display.
Reported by Konrad Podczeck.

*** Mouse pointer color is inverted on Dark Mode.
Though the old behavior is consistent with emacs -rv on X11, it was
actually introduced in version 7.2 as a workaround for the
(set-mouse-color "black") bug, which was fixed in the previous
version.  So the workaround is no longer necessary.

** Improvements

*** Resize transition is also in effect for unfocused frames in Split
View on macOS 10.15.

*** Improve typing response on application-side double buffering.

*** Recognize three-finger editing gestures in Sidecar on macOS 10.15.

** Fixed bugs

*** Candidates window for input methods is often misplaced.
Add heuristics so it works in many cases including candidates windows
popped up during isearch.
We cannot make this placement strictly correct because of a timing
problem: the system asks for the cursor position while there are still
some pending Lisp events and the redisplay is not completed yet.

*** New Space is created when making a child frame visible while a
fullscreen frame is focused.

*** Fail to insert Apple logo if mac-system-coding-system is mac-roman.

*** The name attribute is missing in display-monitor-attributes-list
if the display serial number value is negative in signed int.

** Improvements

*** Update emoji data to UTS #51 version 12.0.

*** Add stipple support.  The "@2x" file name convention and the
`:data-2x' text property at the first byte of the data are also
available to support optional 2x bitmaps for Retina display.

* emacs-26.1-mac-7.3 (2018-10-24)
https://lists.gnu.org/r/emacs-devel/2018-10/msg00439.html

** Fixed bugs

*** Underline for converted text is invisible on dark background.

*** Possible stack overflow (Bug#31995 and Bug#32338).

*** Changing tool bar style (either via the variable tool-bar-style or
tool bar context menu) may make the frame blank with application-side
double buffering, which is forced on macOS 10.14.

*** CPU load is high if application-side double buffering is used.
This is mainly caused by the use of layer-backed views together with
other CALayers involving Core Image filters, and that seems to lead to
excessive CPU time consumption by the CVDisplayLink thread.  Now
overlay views, which host CALayers that use Core Image filters for
several animation effects and drag-and-drop highlighting, are added
into the view hierarchy in an on-demand way to avoid this phenomenon.

*** Drag-and-drop into Emacs frame does not work on Mac OS X 10.6.
This is a regression introduced in 7.2.

*** U+1F9B5 and U+1F9B6 are missing from list of emoji modifier bases.

*** Frames that use application-side double buffering cannot do LCD
font smoothing even on OS X 10.8 - macOS 10.13.
On macOS 10.14, LCD font smoothing is globally disabled by default.
You need to execute "$ defaults write org.gnu.Emacs
CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled -bool NO" to enable it.

*** Sending Apple Events to other applications causes an error on
macOS 10.14.

*** Fail to launch on OS X 10.8.
This is a regression introduced in 7.2.

** Improvement

*** In addition to TIFF, PDF is accepted as pasteboard image data.
Now "Scan Documents" in the context menu on macOS 10.14 can insert PDF
data scanned by your nearby iOS devices (Continuity Camera).

*** New experimental configure option `--with-mac-metal' to use GPU
for pixel copy operations in the frames using application-side double
buffering on OS X 10.11 or later with supported hardware (see
https://support.apple.com/HT205073).  If you are using this feature in
the selected frame, then the expression below will be evaluated to t:
  (and (frame-monitor-attribute 'metal-device-name)
       (not (frame-parameter nil 'inhibit-double-buffering)))
On the Mac port, setting the value of the frame parameter
`inhibit-double-buffering' is only effective at the frame creation
time.  So on OS X 10.11 - macOS 10.13, you need to specify it either
as (make-frame '((inhibit-double-buffering))), by default-frame-alist,
or by X resources emulation via Preferences system (see Mac port
section in Info).  On macOS 10.14, there is no choice other than
application-side double buffering, so you don't need to care about it.
Currently this feature is only tested in very limited environments.
In particular, I can't test it with dynamic switching between
integrated and discrete GPUs.


* emacs-26.1-mac-7.2 (2018-09-09)
https://lists.gnu.org/r/emacs-devel/2018-09/msg00375.html

** Fixed bugs

*** Buffer contents are not displayed on macOS 10.14.
This is mainly because now NSViews are backed by Core Animation Layer
(layer-backed) by default and non-deferred drawing into views no
longer works.  Instead of switching to deferred drawing (i.e., draw
only inside -[NSView drawRect:]), we draw into our own backing bitmap
in a non-deferred way as before, and update the view contents with the
resulting image via -[NSView updateLayer].  This "application-side
double buffering" is also available on OS X 10.8 - macOS 10.13 if you
set the frame parameter `inhibit-double-buffering' to nil when
creating a frame.  Just like on macOS 10.14, such a frame does not do
LCD smoothing.

*** Screenshot grabbed via Services is displayed in wrong size when we
have display mirroring between Retina and non-Retina displays.

*** Cursor movement just after frame resize sometimes leaves garbage.

*** Crash by the Fall_threads call from the GUI thread at the select
emulation when there are multiple Lisp threads.

*** Info title has ASCII underline unlike other window systems.

*** Vertical scroll bar is created as horizontal if frame font height
is short.

** Improvements

*** macOS 10.14 adds property :appearance to (mac-application-state).
The value may be "NSAppearanceNameAqua" or "NSAppearanceNameDarkAqua".

*** Add new color format "mac:COLOR-LIST-NAME:COLOR-NAME" and
"mac:COLOR-NAME" (shorthand for "mac:System:COLOR-NAME").  The actual
color may be different depending on the global appearance setting on
macOS 10.14.  For example, "mac:textColor" is black on the Light Mode
but is white on the Dark Mode.

*** Default frame colors respect appearance setting on macOS 10.14.
Now the default frame foreground/background color is
"mac:textColor"/"mac:textBackgroundColor", respectively.  Changes of
the system setting of the global appearance are dynamically reflected.

*** New function `mac-color-list-alist' to get the available
combinations of COLOR-LIST-NAMEs and COLOR-NAMEs.  Note that this
value is dependent on user environment and OS version.  Also, some
combinations may represent image patterns rather than colors.  For the
former cases, `(color-values "mac:COLOR-LIST-NAME:COLOR-NAME")'
returns nil.

Redesign `select' emulation code to support concurrency on Emacs 26
properly.  Now the Lisp REPL runs in a non-main thread, so the main
thread is dedicated to GUI tasks, which might be requested from
multiple Lisp threads.  The GUI and Lisp threads run mostly
cooperatively (i.e., do not run simultaneously) except in the `select'
emulation.

*** Crash on macOS 10.13 with pinch close to invoke tab overview over
some highlighted text and then clicking the input source menu in the
menu bar.

*** On macOS 10.13.1, pinch close gesture with shift key causes exit
and then enter fullboth.

*** Making frame fullboth is slow on macOS 10.13.1.

*** Crash when showing menu help strings while minibuffer is invisible.
Reported by Konrad Podczeck.

*** Entering fullboth from a fullscreen frame makes it maximized.
This is a regression introduced in 5.90.

*** Entering and then exiting from fullboth makes the frame shorter.

*** Space width for monospace fonts may be wrong.  This is a
regression introduced in 6.1 as "ligature glyph width adjustment".

** Improvements

*** Adopt CFBundleDocumentTypes part from the NS port.
Contributed by Xin Xu.

*** Update emoji data to UTS #51 version 11.0.

*** On macOS 10.13, the pinch close gesture makes the text shrunken
(rather than triggering tab group overview) if the text is magnified.

*** New variable `mac-ignore-accessibility'.
Emacspeak users may want to set this variable so it may not interfere
with the system accessibility services such as VoiceOver.

*** Switching to/from `fullboth' frame does not preserve tool bar.

*** Hourglass (progress indicator) on a dark title bar is invisible.

*** Live resize transition animation does not respect internal border.

*** Some input methods (e.g., Japanese one) on macOS 10.13 do not

** Fixed bugs

*** The format "%x" in `org-capture-templates' does not work.

** Improvements

*** Support the frame parameter `scroll-bar-background' on OS X 10.10
and later.
If it is nil, which is the default, then the frame background color is
used instead.  Its color also affects the appearance of other GUI
parts: the title bar, the tool bar, (the tab bar on macOS 10.12 and
later), scroll bars, and popup menus become light (or dark) if the
color is considered light (or dark, respectively).  On macOS 10.12 and
later, the title/tool/tab bars look slightly colored with the value of
the `scroll-bar-background' frame parameter (or the frame background
color) if the frame is focused and not in fullscreen.

*** Crash when resizing a frame too small by mouse dragging.

*** Can't resize a frame by dragging on macOS 10.13 Beta via Screen
Sharing.app.

** Improvements

*** The fancy splash screen look vibrant on OS X 10.10 and later.
For non-Retina display users, it is recommended to replace
etc/images/splash.png with the alpha-channeled version:
https://bytebucket.org/mituharu/emacs-mac/raw/82af04a197db41d8b9cc3bc04127be2bf01d255f/etc/images/splash.png
This effect can be turned off with "Reduce translucency" in the
Accessibility pane of the System Preferences.

*** On OS X 10.10 and later, if the frame background color is light,
then scroll bars look slightly translucent.
This effect can be turned off with "Reduce translucency" in the
Accessibility pane of the System Preferences.

*** On OS X 10.10 and later, if the frame background color is dark,
then the title bar, the tool bar, (the tab bar on macOS 10.12), scroll
bars, and popup menus look also dark.
The title/tool/tab bars have already looked translucent on macOS 10.12
regardless of the frame background color types.  Text smoothing in
these bars for the focused frame seems to be problematic if the
contents contain Core Animation layers that use Core Image filters
especially with dark window background colors and non-Retina displays.
A change in the last version with respect to window/view hierarchy
manifested this problem, and the use of dark bars works around it.

*** Magnify and rotate events now contain the :phase property.
Now absence of the :phase property in a magnify event means it is a
"smart magnify" event rather than what is caused by a pinch gesture.
On OS X 10.10 and later, its value is either `began', `changed', or
`ended'.  On earlier versions, it is always `none'.

*** New function mac-send-action that sends the specified Cocoa action
using the responder chain for action messages.
Some useful examples of Cocoa actions are `zoom', `hide', `unhide',
`activate', `hideOtherApplications', `unhideAllApplications', and
`orderFrontCharacterPalette'.

*** New function mac-frame-tab-group-property to set tab group
properties.

*** New menu items (mostly in the "Buffers" menu), key bindings
(Control-Tab, Control-Shift-Tab) for tabbing on macOS 10.12 and later.

*** On macOS 10.13 Beta, the pinch close gesture triggers tab group
overview.  If you want to make the text size smaller, first pinch open
and then pinch close without releasing the fingers from the trackpad.
Alternatively, remap the corresponding command as:
  (global-set-key [remap mac-magnify-text-scale-or-overview-tab-group]
                  'mac-magnify-text-scale)

*** On OS X 10.11, the result of Typometer is much worse than that on
the NS port, although better than the both ports on OS X 10.10.  This
is because the Mac port manually defers and coalesces screen flushes
in order to work around slow flyspell.  This seems to be unnecessary
on OS X 10.11, and actually gives a reverse effect as above.

image descriptor or as a text property of the first character of the
standard resolution data (if it is given as a string).

** Fixed bugs

*** M-x tool-bar-mode RET for a fullheight/maximized frame fails on
its first invocation.

*** Wrong size calculations for 2x genuine imagemagick images.  For
example, (image-size (create-image "splash.png" 'imagemagick nil
:max-height 300)) is larger than the one without the :max-height
property if the frame is on a Retina display.

** Improvements

*** For frames on a Retina display, image-io/imagemagick image
descriptors involving non-integral transformations such as shrinking
or rotation are now processed with 2x pixel buffer even if the source
image file/data is for 1x.  For example, (insert-image (create-image
"gnus/gnus.png" 'imagemagick nil :max-height 100)) now looks crisper.

*** Org mode LaTeX fragments preview may also create 2x images.

Blend-and-blur of background color on OS X 10.10 is enabled again
because the mode-line erasure issue (Bug#19721) is fixed upstream.
The function `do-applescript' is now an alias of `mac-do-applescript',
which is implemented on top of `mac-osa-script'.


* emacs-24.4-mac-5.3 (2015-01-29)
https://lists.gnu.org/r/emacs-devel/2015-01/msg01040.html

Blend-and-blur of background color on OS X 10.10 is temporarily
disabled to avoid mode-line erasure on frame focus switch.  For some
reason, mode-line row's `enabled_p' flag in the current matrix is
sometimes reset even if it is visible.  This causes blank mode-line on
"expose" (drawRect:) events.  In principle, this mode-line erasure can
also happen on older versions of OS X or this version of Emacs Mac
port.  But it is usually observed on OS X 10.10 together with previous
5.x versions of Emacs Mac port, because the use of NSVisualEffectView,
which provides the blend-and-blur feature, triggers full frame
"exposure" on focus switch.

** Fixed bugs

*** Special-display completion frame becomes transparent.
Reported by Alan Shumitt.
Adapt a fix for Bug#16619.

*** `mac-auto-ascii-mode' on TTY terminals disables prefix keys with
the meta key.

*** Control-F2 is passed to the system even if
mac-pass-control-to-system is set to nil.

*** Synthetic bold text looks thinner on Retina display/HiDPI mode.
This is because stroke line width for text drawing is not correctly
scaled (whereas it is correctly scaled when drawn to bitmaps) on such
environments.  I've been reporting this to Apple on every OS X update
since it was 10.7.4, but I couldn't get any response until recently.
At last Apple answers that there are no plans to address this issue
(rdar://11644870) currently.  So I added a workaround that would cause
a bad reverse effect if the original issue were fixed.

*** `mac-ae-set-reply-parameter', which is used for reporting an error
in Apple event hander, has not been working since emacs-24.2-mac-3.2.

*** Input source functions ignore disabled input source ID strings.

** Improvements

*** URL handler via Apple events now accepts the `org-protocol' scheme
as well as `mailto'.


* emacs-24.4-mac-5.2 (2014-11-21)

** Fixed bugs

*** The function `mac-osa-script' does not process ARGS (6th and later
arguments) correctly.

** Improvements

*** Even if the current keyboard layout maps some key with the control
modifier to insertion of a character, which would be recognized as an
ordinary insertion in applications that use the standard Cocoa text
view, it is interpreted as a combination with the control modifier.
This behavior is consistent with the Mac port version 4.x and earlier,
and also obviates the previous fix for "C-_" on JIS keyboard.

*** If /usr/include does not exist, then the Xcode SDK dir is examined
as a candidate of libxml2 header location if it does not contain any
special characters or blanks.

*** The function `mac-osa-script' now accepts compiled code, which can
be generated by a new function `mac-osa-compile', and a file name as
well as a script source.
Note: As of OS X 10.10.1, specifying compiled code generated from a
JavaScript source causes crash.  I think this is a bug in OSAKit.

*** New function `mac-do-applescript', which is implemented on top of
`mac-osa-script' and intended as a future replacement of
`do-applescript'.

*** New functions and hooks for interaction with the Text Input Source
Services on Mac OS X 10.5 and later: `mac-input-source',
`mac-input-source-list', `mac-select-input-source',
`mac-deselect-input-source',
`mac-selected-keyboard-input-source-change-hook', and
`mac-enabled-keyboard-input-sources-change-hook'.

*** New global minor mode `mac-auto-ascii-mode' for Mac OS X 10.5 and
later.  If enabled, it automatically selects the most-recently-used
ASCII-capable keyboard input source on some occasions: after prefix
key (bound in the global keymap) press such as C-x and M-g, and at the
start of minibuffer input.
Note: Strictly speaking, its implementation has a timing issue: the
Lisp event queue may already have some input events that have been
processed by some previous keyboard input source but yet to be
processed by the Lisp interpreter.

Reported by OHKAWA Yuichi.

*** Checking "Reduce translucency" in the Accessibility pane in the
System Preferences on OS X 10.10 makes fringe areas translucent.
Reported by Nicholas Riley.

** Improvements

*** Blend-and-blur of fringe background on OS X 10.10 is no longer
hard-coded.  It can be customized per face by specifying a special
name `alpha:ALPHA' as a value of the background stipple attribute.
For example,
  (set-face-stipple 'fringe "alpha:50%")
or
  defaults write org.gnu.Emacs Emacs.fringe.attributeStipple alpha:.5
will (mostly) recover the appearance of the previous release.
Note: Setting stipple for the default face may not work as you expect.
This is the same limitation as the standard stipple feature on X11.
Also, blend-and-blur is temporarily turned off during animations.

*** New experimental functions `mac-osa-language-list' and
`mac-osa-script'.  The latter is like `do-applescript', but can
execute JavaScript as well as AppleScript on OS X 10.10.

** Improvements

*** New variables mac-right-control-modifier,
mac-right-command-modifier, and mac-right-option-modifier.
Note: the left and right versions cannot be distinguished on some
environments such as Screen Sharing.  Also, certain combinations of a
key with both versions of the same modifier do not emit events at the
system level.

*** A single physical modifier key can be mapped to different Emacs
modifiers depending on its input type (ordinary keys, function keys,
or mouse operations) using the property list format `(:ordinary SYMBOL
:function SYMBOL :mouse SYMBOL)'.  By default, the option key works as
the normal Mac option key for the ordinary keys, and as the Alt
modifier for the function keys and the mouse operations.

High-resolution icons are now distributed as a separate package.
File notification is supported via GLib (you'll also need `pkg-config'
when running the configure command).
The `image-io' image type supports `:max-width', `:max-height', and
`:format' keywords just as in `imagemagick'.
Now that Image mode supports multi-frame image navigation (`f', 'b',
and `F'), you can browse multi-page documents in several formats that
`image-io' supports (e.g., PDF and DOC) with the setting like this:
  (when (and (image-type-available-p 'image-io)
	     (not (boundp 'imagemagick-render-type)))
     ;; Image I/O is used as a fallback of ImageMagick.

     (setq imagemagick-types-inhibit
	  (cons 'XML (delq 'PDF imagemagick-types-inhibit)))

Note: if you have ImageMagick installed, you need to build the Mac

can be used as a fallback of `imagemagick'.

* emacs-24.3-rc1-mac-3.94 [experimental/hackers-only] (2013-03-05)
Based on Emacs 24.3 release candidate 1.  Remove mac-system-locale.
When the locale setting is derived from the Preferences AppleLocale or
AppleLanguages (i.e., none of "LC_ALL", "LC_CTYPE" or "LANG" is set),
encoding is assumed to be UTF-8.

** Fixed bugs

*** Daemon mode crashes when connected from `emacsclient -c'.
Reported by Pavlo Martynenko.

*** Waste CPU time when there is an iconified frame.
Reported by Pavlo Martynenko.

*** Frame display is not updated immediately when deiconified.

** Fixed bugs

*** Rare crash in mac_get_selected_range.

*** Breakage of `--with-wide-int' on other builds.
Reported by Peter Dyballa.
Note: the option `--with-wide-int' is not eagerly tested on the Mac port.
Use it at your own risk.

*** `emacsclient -c' does not work.
Reported by Piotr Kalinowski.

** Improvements

*** Work around the problem that scrolling may leave some spots when
LCD text smoothing is enabled.

OS X 10.8.

*** Key events are discarded while AppleScript is executed.

** Fixed bugs

*** Disabling tool bar mode via the Preference system (X resources
emulation) does not work.
Reported by Leo.

*** Tool bar visibility is not preserved when entering/exiting full
screen on Mac OS X 10.7 and later (actually this is a bug in AppKit).

*** Background color is not in sRGB color space for image types GIF,
PNG, TIFF, and IMAGE-IO.

** Improvements

*** You can run the executable from the build directory (via `open
mac/Emacs.app') without doing `make install'.  Forgot to mention in
the previous release.

*** Support alpha channel masks for image types GIF, PNG, TIFF, and
IMAGE-IO with keeping the postprocessing functionality (`:conversion'
and `:mask').  Not for SVG images rendered with WebKit because proper
text smoothing requires opaque background.


* emacs-24.2.90-mac-3.90 [experimental/hackers-only] (2012-11-25)

* emacs-24.2-mac-3.3 (2012-10-27)

** Fixed bugs

*** Wrong glyph advancement calculation in text shaping for non-zero
advance delta cases.

*** Full screen transition animations are not correct on OS X 10.8.

*** XBM foreground and background are not in sRGB color space.

*** mac-file-alias-p returns t for symbolic links on Mac OS X 10.6 and
later.
Reported by Leo.

*** Scroll bar thumb dragging is not right on Mac OS X 10.6 and
earlier (regression by the previous fix for Mac OS X 10.7 and later.)

** Improvements

*** Help key no longer activates "context help mode" (question-mark
mouse pointer).

*** Popup menu shown by C-mouse-down-1 now includes contextual menu on
Mac OS X 10.6 and later.  Other popup menus remain quiet.

*** Some combinations of regional indicator symbols such as U+1F1EF
followed by U+1F1F5 now display national flags in color emoji on Mac
OS X 10.7 and later.


* emacs-24.2-mac-3.2 (2012-08-27)
Based on Emacs 24.2.
https://lists.gnu.org/r/emacs-devel/2012-08/msg00803.html

** Fixed bugs

*** Preferred font family selection does not work on OS X 10.8.

** Improvements

*** If Emacs.app is launched from Finder or via Resume on OS X 10.8,
then it inherits environment variable settings of user's login shell
regardless of the existence of ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist, which is
ignored on OS X 10.8 anyway.

*** Use sRGB color space instead of device RGB.  This does not change
the appearance on OS X 10.8 which regards device RGB as sRGB.


* emacs-24.1-mac-3.1 (2012-07-26)
https://lists.gnu.org/r/emacs-devel/2012-07/msg00561.html

** Fixed bugs

*** Scrolling up the contents of a buffer with a header line by mouse
wheel is sometimes jumpy.

*** Several glitches on PowerPC (such as not displaying fringe
bitmaps) due to overlooked WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN -> WORDS_BIGENDIAN change.

*** SVG image (rendered via WebKit) might be clipped if width or
height is unspecified.
Reported by Leo.
Now use max X or Y value of the bounding box if width or height is
specified as a percentage value or unspecified.

*** Double-tapping either a touch-sensitive mouse with one finger or a
trackpad with two fingers on Mac OS X 10.8 64-bit build is ignored.

** Improvements

*** Double-tapping either a touch-sensitive mouse with one finger or a
trackpad with two fingers on Mac OS X 10.7 and later now scales the
text to 150% if previously unscaled and the pointer lies between the
indentation and end of line.

*** Text scaling by gestures now tries to keep the vertical position
of the text under the pointer.

*** Support automatic selection of high resolution versions of images.
All supported image types respect the "@2x" file name convention.  SVG
images (via WebKit or librsvg) are rendered according to the backing
scale factor.  An appropriate image is selected from a multiimage TIFF
containing both 1x and 2x images if the image spec does not contain an
explicit `:index' property.

*** Prefer the integrated GPU to the discrete one for saving battery.
This requires Mac OS X 10.7 and Early 2011 MacBook Pro.

*** The `page-curl' transition does not look right on Mac OS X 10.5.

*** Wrong display of the backside image for the
`page-curl-with-shadow' transition on Mac OS X 10.7 with HiDPI mode.

*** Wrong display of animations on Mac OS X 10.5 and 10.6 when
resolution independence is in effect.

*** Incomplete input area (aka "active input area", "marked text", or
"preedit area") does not respect buffer text scaling.
Apply Chong Yidong's fix for Bug#2066.


* emacs-24.1-rc-mac-2.94 [experimental/hackers-only] (2012-06-01)
Based on Emacs 24.1 release candidate
https://lists.gnu.org/r/emacs-devel/2012-06/msg00009.html

** Improvements

*** Animation now supports the built-in Core Image transition filters
via Core Animation.  The "About Emacs" and "Preferences..." menu items
in the application menu (labeled "Emacs") in the menu bar are
accompanied with a transition animation effect on Mac OS X 10.5 and
later.  Animation is suppressed if the frame is not completely opaque,
because it does not give an intended effect on such frames.

Known issues: The `page-curl' transition does not look right on Mac OS
X 10.5.  Also, the `page-curl-with-shadow' transition does not look
right for some angles on Mac OS X 10.7.4.  Both transitions look
blurry on Mac OS X 10.7.4 with HiDPI mode.

** Fixed bugs

*** HiDPI mode gives a blurry magnified text look on Mac OS X 10.7.3.

*** HiDPI mode shows wrong animation on transition from/to full screen.

*** M-x electric-pair-mode RET gives the warning "Note, built-in
variable `imagemagick-render-type' not bound".
Reported by Leo.

*** Tooltip place adjustment does not take account of multiple
monitors.
Reported by Pavel Martynenko.

*** Drag-and-drop highlight is not displayed just after exiting from
full screen.

*** Momentum scroll events after horizontal flicking interfere with a
multi-key sequence.

*** "Emacs" (in the menu bar) -> "About Emacs" then typing "q" causes
an error.

** Improvements

*** Support right-to-left text shaping.

*** New variable `mac-system-move-file-to-trash-use-finder', which
enables us to use the Finder for trashing so we can `Put Back' the
trashed items from the context menu.

*** Buffer switching by horizontal swiping/flicking and exiting from
the splash screen are accompanied with an experimental simple
animation effect on Mac OS X 10.5 and later.


* emacs-24.0.94-mac-2.90 [experimental/hackers-only] (2012-03-03)
Based on Emacs 24.0.94.  Drop support for Mac OS X 10.2 and 10.3.
Be aware of the (platform-independent) change in selection:
mouse-dragging no longer automatically copies the selected text to the
clipboard without M-w or `Copy' in the menu bar or the tool bar,
unless you set `mouse-drag-copy-region' to t.
https://lists.gnu.org/r/emacs-devel/2012-03/msg00030.html

** Fixed bugs

*** If compiled with ARC, "Emacs" (in the menu bar) -> "About Emacs"
leads to crash.

*** Emacs -q --eval "(set-frame-parameter nil 'fullscreen 'fullboth)"
does not hide the menu bar.
Reported by Leo.

** Improvements

*** New image type `image-io', which is parallel to `imagemagick' but
uses the Image I/O framework.  If not configured to link with the
ImageMagick library, then `image-io' provides a fallback
implementation of the `imagemagick' image type.

*** The variable `tool-bar-style' works like in GTK+.  The values
`both-horiz', `text-image-horiz' are synonymous with `both'.

*** Flicking either a touch-sensitive mouse with one finger or a
trackpad with two fingers horizontally issues a swipe-left/swipe-right
event, which is now bound to a simple buffer switching by default.

** Improvements

*** If Emacs.app is launched from Finder or via Resume, and there is
no ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist file, then it inherits environment
variable settings of user's login shell.  Note that if Emacs.app is
launched via the `open' command on Mac OS X 10.4 and later, then it
inherits environment variable settings of the shell where the command
is invoked, and this behavior is unchanged.

platform-specific, but happens more frequently on Mac OS X 10.7.
Apply a fix for Bug#9415.

*** Crash when a separator is displayed in the tool bar on Mac OS X
10.7.

*** Can't toggle tool bar visibility for maximized frames on Mac OS X
10.7.

*** While executing AppleScript, pressing the down arrow key is
misinterpreted as `C-_' (usually bound to the undo command).
Reported by Leo.

*** Memory leak by y-or-n-p-with-timeout with GUI (Bug#9830).

** Improvements

*** Can compile with ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) on Xcode 4.2.
Specify CC="clang -fobjc-arc" on configure.

*** When running Ediff on a fullboth frame, it no longer gets obscured
by the menu bar or the Dock even if we focus Ediff Control Panel.

*** Unlike fullboth frames, fullscreen frames no longer occupy the
whole desktop area on Mac OS X 10.7 when the desktop width/height is
not a multiple of the nominal character width/height, respectively.

** Fixed bugs

*** Devanagari string U+0936 U+094D U+0930 U+093F (3 consonants
followed by 1 vowel, but the glyph corresponding to the last vowel
should be displayed first) is displayed wrong and may cause hang.
Reported by Tsuyoshi YASUMA.

*** Executables compiled on Mac OS X 10.6 with
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.5 do not run on Mac OS X 10.5.  This is a
regression introduced in 1.9994.
Note: executables compiled on Mac OS X 10.7 with
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.6 and some optimization flag still do not
run on Mac OS X 10.6, but I think this is a bug about weak linking in
the compiler or linker in Xcode 4.1 and already reported to Apple.

*** Updating display while a frame is resized from the bottom-right
corner does not work via Screen Sharing.  This is a regression
introduced in 1.9993.

*** Updating display while a frame is resized does not work from
non-bottom-right corners or edges on Mac OS X 10.7.

*** Some CPU consumption is observed even if executed with -Q -D (no
timer for cursor blinking) and M-x tool-bar-mode RET on Mac OS X 10.7.

** Fixed bugs

*** SVG display by WebKit is disabled on 64-bit executables.

*** The "Special Characters ..." item in the "Edit" menu doesn't
appear in non-English locales.

*** LastResort font is not shown on Mac OS X 10.7.

*** Pointer shape around the edges/corners becomes the pointing arrow
rather than the resizing arrows on Mac OS X 10.7 when mouse moved.

** Improvements

*** Support for the full screen mode introduced in Mac OS X 10.7.
Now `fullscreen' and `fullboth' values for the `fullscreen' frame
parameter have different meanings on Mac OS X 10.7: the former means a
new system-wide full screen mode with a dedicated desktop (or Space),
and the latter means the existing fullscreen feature.

Known issues: the menu bar does not appear with Control-F2 or
Command-Shift-/, and the tool bar is shown when mouse is moved to the
top even when tool-bar-mode is turned off.  I think these are bugs
(already reported to Apple), and I'd like to see if the situation
is changed with some future OS updates rather than tweaking with some
workarounds.

*** On Mac OS X 10.7, double-tapping either a touch-sensitive mouse
with one finger or a trackpad with two fingers changes the buffer text
scaling to unscaled if previously scaled.  And if previously unscaled,
then the buffer text is scaled so the default font occupies at least
`mac-text-scale-standard-width' columns in the tapped window.

** Improvements

*** Color bitmap fonts such as Apple Color Emoji can be displayed if
compiled and run on Mac OS X 10.7.

*** Drag-and-drop highlights the frame under the pointer.

*** Option key temporarily inverts the "Jump to the spot that's
clicked" setting for scroll bars as in other applications.

*** Option key temporarily changes the behavior of line-up/down scroll
bar buttons to page-up/down as in other applications.

*** Holding shift key on startup is recognized as -Q option.

** Notes

*** This release is meant to make minimal adjustment for Mac OS X
10.7.  Don't expect integration with new features of Lion except the
color emoji display support mentioned above.

*** SVG support by WebKit is disabled on 64-bit executables for now,
because it may hang while initializing plugins in some cases.  If you
do need SVG display, then build as a 32-bit executable or use librsvg.

** Fixed bugs

*** Text scaling by pinch out/in and by C-x C-+/C-- are not in sync.

*** Shift-Tab is recognized as Tab, and keyboard navigation after
Command-Shift-/ doesn't work on Mac OS X 10.6.  These are regressions
caused by the previous fix for the DefaultKeyBinding.dict problem.

*** Successive paste of the same image from other applications via the
clipboard causes duplication in the kill ring.  Reported by Leo.  This
is a regression caused by the previous fix.

*** Fonts in highlighted words with the pop-up dictionary
(Command-Control-D) are sometimes incorrect.  This is a regression
caused by refactoring for the accessibility support.

** Improvements

*** Font design destination can be specified via the `:destination'
font property.  The value 1 means the destination is video text as in
the XLFD Conventions, and screen font metrics are used in that case.
You can see the difference with (make-frame '((font
. "Monaco-9:antialias=off:destination=1"))), for example.

*** Successive SVG image loading in `vrend-clock' by Anders Waldenborg
(https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-gnu-emacs/2010-05/msg00521.html)
fails in a few seconds.

*** The variable `face-ignored-fonts' does not work.
Apply Kenichi Handa's fix for Bug#6287.
This is useful when you want to turn off synthetic bold for some fonts
like (add-to-list 'face-ignored-fonts "\\`-[^-]*-monaco-bold-").
Synthetic bold seems to become lighter if the background is darker
than the foreground and the LCD font smoothing is turned on.

** Improvements

*** "Speak selected text with when the key is pressed", which can be
customized in the Speech pane in the System Preferences, now works.

*** New events: magnify-up/down and rotate-left/right.  They are for
newer trackpads with Mac OS X 10.5.2 and later.  By default,
magnify-up/down, which are issued by pinch out/in, are bound to
scaling text size by text-scale-mode.  With the shift key, they turn
on/off fullscreen status of the frame.

*** Experimental support for accessibility with respect to the custom
view for Emacs frames.  Still there are several glitches.

*** Tooltips don't respect customized `tooltip' face font setting.

*** Font specs specified for non-ASCII characters in a non-default
fontset are not used in new frames.  Reported by Ichiro Enoki.

** Improvements

*** New function `mac-file-alias-p', which is parallel to
`file-symlink-p'.

** Fixed bugs

*** 64-bit binary built on Mac OS X 10.5 does not run on 10.6.

*** `make bootstrap' fails (though it is not required for normal
installation).  Reported by Leo.

** Improvements

*** `do-applescript' regards a given multibyte string as Unicode text.
It behaves as in Emacs 22 if the script is given as a unibyte string.

** Fixed bugs

*** Crash when showing a tooltip on a secondary monitor.

*** Can't quit while establishing a TCP connection.
Apply a fix for Bug#5723 as well as Helmut Eller's fix for Bug#5173.

** Improvements

*** When a maximized frame is moved with title bar dragging on a
multiple monitor environment, the destination monitor is determined by
the mouse position at the end of dragging.  If such a frame is moved
programmatically, the destination monitor is determined by the maximum
area of the contained part of the frame as before.

*** Menu item "Open Selected File in Emacs" is shown in Services or
context menu of other applications by default on Mac OS X 10.6 when
absolute pathname-like text is selected.

*** Emacs info nodes are accessible via search field in the Help menu
if compiled and run on Mac OS X 10.6.

*** "Click in the scroll bar to: Jump to the spot that's clicked"
setting in the System Preferences is supported.

Based on Emacs 23.1.94
https://lists.gnu.org/r/emacs-devel/2010-03/msg00390.html

** Fixed bugs

*** Dictionary popped up with Command-Control-D is misplaced when a
word in a partially-visible line is looked up.

*** Drag-n-dropping a file into a Message buffer opens the file
instead of adding it as an attachment.  Reported by Leo.

*** Crash when a text is drag-n-dropped into the Dock icon.
Reported by Leo.

*** Not registered as a service provider on Mac OS X 10.4 and earlier,
even if there is no other instance of running Emacs.

*** Modifier mapping for the `fn' key does not work with the `A' key.

** Improvements

*** Reverse conversion in Kotoeri works even without selection.
Hitting Eisu/Kana key on JIS keyboard (or Control-Shift-;/J/K on US
keyboard) twice also works.

Based on Emacs 23.1.93
https://lists.gnu.org/r/emacs-devel/2010-02/msg00665.html

** Fixed bugs

*** Menu selection via search field in the Help menu doesn't work on
Mac OS X 10.6.
Note: this seems to be still unstable on Mac OS X 10.5.8, crashing at
the function TestMenuSystemAttributes in the HIToolbox framework.
I've experienced similar crashes even with Safari on that version.

*** The function `menu-bar-open' does not activate the menu bar.

*** Menu bar does not get updated after Command-H -> Dock icon click
on Mac OS X 10.5.

** Improvements

*** Scroll bars are excluded from flashed area for visible bell in a
consistent way.

*** Several keyboard shortcuts (notably those for Keyboard Navigation)
listed in System Preferences now work.

Based on Emacs 23.1.92
https://lists.gnu.org/r/emacs-devel/2010-01/msg01487.html

** Fixed bugs

*** Turning on the toolbar in a fullscreen frame leaves garbage if it
has non-zero internal border width.

** Improvements

*** When the clipboard has both textual and image data, yank inserts
the former and push both into the kill ring so the latter can be
inserted with yank-pop afterwards.

*** Use non-integral x positions for displaying antialiased
proportional fonts.  You can see the difference by putting the box
cursor over Helvetica 12pt `I', whose ideal width is 3.33398 but
displayed with the rounded width 3, for example.

Based on Emacs 23.1.91
https://lists.gnu.org/r/emacs-devel/2009-12/msg01112.html

** Fixed bugs

*** The `fullboth' frames, which don't have a title bar, are not shown
in the window list in the Dock menu.

*** Mouse highlighting is not updated on popup (de)activations.

*** With `x-select-font', the first click in a list sometimes results
in a wrong selection.

*** Command line options specifying temporary preferences settings
(e.g., -AppleDisplayScaleFactor 1.25 -AppleAntiAliasingThreshold 14),
just as in other Cocoa applications, are regarded as if they are
specifying filenames to edit.

** Improvements

*** Change of text smoothing threshold setting in the Appearance pane
of the System Preferences is now reflected immediately.

** Fixed bugs

*** Can't get Unicode Variation Sequences subtable for Hanazono font
(2009-12-01, TTF) on Mac OS X 10.4 and earlier.

** Improvements

*** Fullscreen works like with ewmh-compliant X11 window managers.
Note: currently, `fullboth' frames, which don't have a title bar, are
not shown in the window list in the Dock menu.


* emacs-23.1-mac-1.94 [experimental/hackers-only] (2009-11-01)
https://lists.gnu.org/r/emacs-devel/2009-11/msg00001.html

** Fixed bugs

*** Kill/yank in tty frames causes an error.

** Improvements

*** When delete-selection-mode is enabled, then the active region is
hidden while the marked text is being shown (so "Reverse conversion"
in Kotoeri looks better).

*** The current cursor position may be returned for a character
position query for text input even if the marked text is not displayed
or handled at the Lisp level yet (so auxiliary windows in AquaSKK 4
are placed better.)

*** SVG images are supported via WebKit on Mac OS X 10.4 and later.
If you have librsvg installed and you want to use WebKit for rendering
SVG images, then you need to specify --without-rsvg as a configure
option.

*** The Mac font backend driver now supports `get_variation_glyphs'
also on Mac OS X 10.4 and earlier.

*** Ideographic Variation Sequences (IVSes) also work for Hiragino
fonts, which don't have a format 14 (Unicode Variation Sequences)
subtable in their cmap table.

https://lists.gnu.org/r/emacs-devel/2009-09/msg00745.html

** Fixed bugs

*** Conversion between Lisp and NSPasteboard strings doesn't preserve
NUL characters.

*** Mouse face reacts even while tracking Dock menus or Stacks.

*** Control-Q does not work as the quote binding in file dialogs.

*** Synthetic bold does not work for bitmap-only fonts on Mac OS X
10.6.

** Improvements

*** New events: wheel-left/right as in W32, and
swipe-up/down/left/right on Mac OS X 10.5.2 and later.

*** The Mac font backend driver now supports `get_variation_glyphs' on
Mac OS X 10.5 and later.  You need some OpenType font containing a
format 14 (Unicode Variation Sequences) subtable in its cmap table.

*** Simplified `select' emulation also for Mac OS X 10.5 and earlier.
Its design is similar to the one in the previous release with Grand
Central Dispatch.

** Fixed bugs

*** Command-Control-D doesn't pop up dictionary on Mac OS X 10.6.

*** Iconified frames aren't considered visible.
Reported by Benjamin Riefenstahl.

*** Can't make iconified frames invisible.

** Improvements

*** Fall back on mac-system-coding-system if script and language
information is not available in text input events.

*** New implementation for the `select' emulation using Grand Central
Dispatch instead of CFSocket.  It is enabled by default if built for
Mac OS X 10.6.  If you find it unstable/problematic, then you can turn
it off by compiling with "-DSELECT_USE_GCD=0".

** Fixed bugs

*** Doesn't build on Mac OS X 10.6.

*** Multi-page TIFF images are not supported.
I thought they were, but I actually added the code to another working
tree and forgot to merge it in the previous version.

*** "Visit New File" shows a wrong dialog.
Apply Jason Rumney's fix for Bug#3969.

*** Mach port right leaks due to the previous change for the warning
"CFMessagePort: bootstrap_register(): failed".

** Improvements

*** File and font dialogs can be closed with C-g on Mac OS X 10.5 and later.


* emacs-23.1-mac-1.90 [experimental/hackers-only] (2009-08-03)
Based on Emacs 23.1.  Rename from "Carbon+AppKit port" to "Mac port".
Drop support for Mac OS X 10.1 and earlier.
Drop GUI implementation with Carbon HIToolbox.
Revamp font handing completely.

** Fixed bugs

*** "open -g" (available on Mac OS X 10.5 and later) does not work.

*** Control-Tab is not recognized on Mac OS X 10.4 and earlier.

** Improvements

*** Resizing truncates the window width/height to multiple of the
nominal character size instead of rounding unless the resizing is
triggered by mouse dragging of the resize handle.

*** Warning "CFMessagePort: bootstrap_register(): failed" with
multiple invocations via command-line or "open -n" is suppressed
(except for Mac OS X 10.4).


* emacs-22.3-appkit-1.4 (2009-06-27)
https://lists.gnu.org/r/emacs-devel/2009-06/msg00532.html

** Fixed bugs

*** Fringe bitmap display is incorrect if its width is not 8.

*** Crash when calculating Quickdraw font metrics in an invisible frame.

*** Crash when changing internal-border-width of an invisible frame.

*** Assertion failure in mac_set_font.

*** "Hide" in Login Items does not work.

*** (mac-pasteboard-string-to-string "\342\204\246" 'mac-roman) gives
GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA instead of OHM SIGN (likewise for
mac-utxt-to-string).

*** mac-symbol -> emacs-mule mapping is represented wrong for #x30 - #x37.

** Improvements

*** Conversion between CFNumber and Lisp objects now uses Lisp strings
for integers that don't fit in the Lisp float range.

https://lists.gnu.org/r/emacs-devel/2009-03/msg00261.html

*** Popup dialog does not select the default item with the return key.

*** Tooltip contents are sometimes not shown on 10.4 due to the
previous change for flyspell-small-region slowness.

** Improvements

*** Hourglass (progress indicator) is shown in the title bar.

*** Add f20 and kp-separator to the keycode-to-xkeysym table.


* emacs-22.3-appkit-1.2 (2009-01-24)
https://lists.gnu.org/r/emacs-devel/2009-01/msg00753.html

** Fixed bugs

*** do-applescript crashes with -nw due to the previous fix for
(do-applescript "choose file") hang.

*** Cursor erasure sometimes fails on Mac OS X 10.5 due to the
previous change for flyspell-small-region slowness.

*** Buffer overrun in creation of Vmac_carbon_version_string.

** Improvements

*** Untag Lisp_Object by subtraction instead of masking.
https://lists.gnu.org/r/emacs-devel/2008-01/msg01876.html

*** `select' emulation waits for user signal delivery as well as
window system events and process outputs via sockets.
https://lists.gnu.org/r/emacs-devel/2008-10/msg00198.html

*** Hourglass display is enabled.

*** Let the framework decide whether wheel events to non-focus frames
are accepted or not.


* emacs-22.3-appkit-1.1 (2008-11-27)
https://lists.gnu.org/r/emacs-devel/2008-11/msg00993.html

** Fixed bugs

*** 64-bit binary doesn't work with AquaSKK Japanese input method.

*** Tooltip contents are chopped off if the fractional part of the
scaling factor is greater than or equal to 0.5.

*** Crash with tooltip autodisplay that happens when its contents are
not yet ready.

*** (do-applescript "choose file") -> cancel -> hang on 10.5.

*** With asynchronous subprocesses, the "[Complete, but not unique]"
message shown by C-x C-f / TAB TAB will disappear on key release.

http://emacsbugs.donarmstrong.com/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1337

** Improvements

*** Execution of flyspell-small-region is no longer too slow.

*** The "Visit New File" dialog no longer confirms replacement if an
existing file is specified (only on 10.3 and later).

*** Update display while the resize control (or the slider in the font
panel) is being dragged.

*** Align key bindings shown in a menu.

*** Explicitly link with libncurses.5 if MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET <
1040 to avoid runtime link error when running on the versions without
/usr/lib/libncurses.5.4.dylib.
