In this directory is a collection of scripts which arrange to upload
tests (or rather arbitrary Lisp forms) from an Emacs source repository
into an Android device, execute them "in vivo", so to speak, and
retrieve the results of their execution.  While there is an automatic
testing system built around another version of these scripts, the
versions in the Emacs repository are engineered for interactive
execution only.
