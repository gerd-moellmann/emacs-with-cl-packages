This directory holds a minuscule stub executable that invokes the
appropriate Java APIs to execute an activity with string array
parameters.  It is not necessary on systems that have received AOSP
commit:

  https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/28600e2%5E%21/

which is to say, Android 5.0 (API 21) or newer.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
In consequence of this stub's liberal usage of private APIs, you must
compile this executable yourself, and link it against a copy of the
Android framework libraries extracted from a real installation of
Android 4.4.x and processed through `dex2jar':

  https://github.com/pxb1988/dex2jar

The resultant class file, once further compiled into Dex bytecode with
`d8' and archived, must be renamed "stub.zip" and placed in this
directory; for example:

  $ adb pull /system/framework/framework.jar
  /system/framework/framework.jar: 1 file pulled, 0 skipped. 1.6 MB/s (3818859 bytes in 2.342s)
  $ adb pull /system/framework/core.jar
  /system/framework/core.jar: 1 file pulled, 0 skipped. 1.6 MB/s (1237856 bytes in 0.743s)
  $ dex2jar {core,framework}.jar
  dex2jar core.jar -> ./core-dex2jar.jar
  dex2jar framework.jar -> ./framework-dex2jar.jar
  $ javac AtsStub.java -source 1.6 -classpath "core-dex2jar.jar:framework-dex2jar.jar"
  $ d8 AtsStub.class && zip stub.zip classes.dex
