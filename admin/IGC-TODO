Todo list for scratch/igc

- Complete the code to mirror the object graph in a loaded dump in MPS.

- Write the code that replaces references to the loaded dump with
  references to the mirrored graph in all roots.

- Implement weak hash tables.

- Write the code to handle marker lists, undo list etc.

- Maybe implement weak-ptr for the old GC.

- Make native compilation work on macOS. (Might be fixed with Helmut's
  exact root approach, but can't check because Homebrew libgccjit 14.1
  makes problems when configuring (libgcc_s.dylib not found)).
