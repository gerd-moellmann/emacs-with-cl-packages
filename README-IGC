This directory tree contains a version of Emacs master branch that
implements a new garbage collection for Emacs that is based on
Ravenbrook's MPS library.  The new GC is concurrent, incremental, and
generational.


Building this branch
====================

This branch can be built with and without the new GC (igc). If you want
to build with igc, you will need to install the MPS library
'libmps'.  How to install the library differs from system to system, see
'Installing libmps' below.

How to build Emacs from a Git checkout is described in the file
INSTALL.REPO.  Everything said there applies to this branch as well.
When you have 'libmps' installed, you can configure Emacs to use it with
the new configure option '--with-mps'.

Use

  --with-mps=yes	to use the production version of libmps
  --with-mps=debug      to use the debug version of libmps
  --with-mps=no         to not use MPS (or don't use '--with-mps')

In addition, you can configure with

  --enable-checking=igc_assert

to enable igc-specific assertions.
