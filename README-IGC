This directory tree contains a version of Emacs master branch that
implements a new garbage collection for Emacs that is based on
Ravenbrook's MPS library.  The new GC is concurrent, incremental, and
generational.


Building this branch
====================

This branch can be built with and without the new GC (igc). If you want
to build with igc, you will need to install the MPS library
'libmps'.  How to install the library differs from system to system, see
'Installing libmps' below.

How to build Emacs from a Git checkout is described in the file
INSTALL.REPO.  Everything said there applies to this branch as well.
When you have 'libmps' installed, you can configure Emacs to use it with
the new configure option '--with-mps'.

Use

  --with-mps=yes	to use the production version of libmps
  --with-mps=debug      to use the debug version of libmps
  --with-mps=no         to not use MPS (or don't use '--with-mps')

In addition, you can configure with

  --enable-checking=igc_assert

to enable igc-specific assertions.


Installing 'libmps'
===================

macOS with Homebrew
-------------------

Install 'libmps' from Homebrew with

  brew install libmps

MS-Windows
----------

TDB

Debian...

TBD

Building MPS yourself
---------------------

Clone the MPS repository:

$ git clone https://github.com/Ravenbrook/mps.git

See the file mps/INSTALL for instructions on how to build MPS.  But in
short:

$ cd mps/code

$ gcc -O2 mps.c
$ ar rvs libmps.a mps.o

Then you can proceed with building Emacs, telling the `configure` script
where mps.h and libmps.a are:

$ configure CPPFLAGS=-I/path/to/mps/code LDFLAGS=-L/path/to/mps/code --with-mps=yes ... other options

(replace /path/to/mps/code with the path to the mps/code directory.)

To build the debug version of MP:

$ gcc -O0 -g -DCONFIG_VAR_COOL -c mpc.c -o mps-debug.o
$ ar rvs libmps-debug.a mps-debug.o

Then pass --with-mps=debug instead --with-mps=yes to the Emacs configure
script (it is recommended that you build Emacs in debug mode while
debugging MPS problems, see the INSTALL in the root directory of the
Emacs source tree.)
