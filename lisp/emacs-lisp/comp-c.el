;;; Commentary:

;; Native compilation uses the GCC jit compilation library. The Lisp
;; part of the native compiler translates byte code to an IR that is
;; translated to GCC jit IR in comp.c in a last pass (function
;; comp--final).
;;
;; To generate C code instead, we reuse the native compiler except its
;; last pass comp--final. We translate the native compiler's IR to C
;; which we can be used with other compilers. The intermediate C
;; representation is used because it is much simpler to generate.
