;;; Commentary:

;; Native compilation uses the GCC jit compilation library. The Lisp
;; part of the native compiler translates byte code to an IR that is
;; translated to GCC jit IR in comp.c in a last pass (function
;; comp--final).
;;
;; For ORC, we reuse the native compiler except its last pass
;; comp--final. We translate the native compiler's IR to C which we can
;; pass to LLVM ORC. The intermediate C representation is used because
;; it is much simpler to generate.
