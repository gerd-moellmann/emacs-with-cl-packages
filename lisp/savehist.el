;;; Commentary:

;; Many editors (e.g. Vim) have the feature of saving minibuffer
;; history to an external file after exit.  This package provides the
;; same feature in Emacs.  When set up, it saves recorded minibuffer
;; histories to a file (`~/.emacs.d/history' by default).  Additional
;; variables may be specified by customizing
;; `savehist-additional-variables'.

;; To use savehist, turn on savehist-mode by putting the following in
;; `~/.emacs':
;;
;;     (savehist-mode 1)
;;
;; or with customize: `M-x customize-option RET savehist-mode RET'.
;;
;; You can also explicitly save history with `M-x savehist-save' and
;; load it by loading the `savehist-file' with `M-x load-file'.

Each element is a variable that will be persisted across Emacs

An element may be variable name (a symbol) or a cons cell of the form
\(VAR . MAX-SIZE), which means to truncate VAR's value to at most
MAX-SIZE elements (if the value is a list) before saving the value.

The contents of variables should be printable with the Lisp
printer.  You don't need to add minibuffer history variables to
this list, all minibuffer histories will be saved automatically
as long as `savehist-save-minibuffer-history' is non-nil.

User options should be saved with the Customize interface.  This
list is useful for saving automatically updated variables that are not
minibuffer histories, such as `compile-command' or `kill-ring'.

gracefully concurrent modifications to the `savehist-file', e.g. by other

(define-minor-mode savehist-mode
  "Toggle saving of minibuffer history (Savehist mode).

When Savehist mode is enabled, minibuffer history is saved
to `savehist-file' periodically and when exiting Emacs.  When
Savehist mode is enabled for the first time in an Emacs session,
it loads the previous minibuffer histories from `savehist-file'.
The variable `savehist-autosave-interval' controls the
periodicity of saving minibuffer histories.

If `savehist-save-minibuffer-history' is non-nil (the default),
all recorded minibuffer histories will be saved.  You can arrange
for additional history variables to be saved and restored by
customizing `savehist-additional-variables', which by default is
an empty list.  For example, to save the history of commands
invoked via \\[execute-extended-command], add `command-history' to the list in
`savehist-additional-variables'.

Alternatively, you could customize `savehist-save-minibuffer-history'
to nil, and add to `savehist-additional-variables' only those
history variables you want to save.

To ignore some history variables, add their symbols to the list
in `savehist-ignored-variables'.

This mode should normally be turned on from your Emacs init file.
Calling it at any other time replaces your current minibuffer
histories, which is probably undesirable."
